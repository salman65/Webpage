# Webpage
Mastering HTML and CSS by making my own portfolio. Used pure HTML and CSS, without any library support, including bootstrap. There are a little responsiveness issues, tried to handle them but could not do so everywhere.

*Next task is to make it totally reponsive and use bootstrap as much as possible.

Made it using bootstrap. A lot of alignment and responsiveness issues are handled but still some issues related to text and custom shapes persist.

Made several web applications using Javascript for practice. Then made my own Timezone project which takes in city and GMT parameters and outputs the realtime clock in return. The application has session storage properties to retain the data on page reload.

*Next task is to practice react.js.
