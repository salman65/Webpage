Mastering HTML and CSS by making my own portfolio. Used pure HTML and CSS, without any library support, including bootstrap. There are a little responsiveness issues, tried to handle them but could not do so everywhere.
Next task is to make it totally reponsive and use bootstrap as much as possible.
