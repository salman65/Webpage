Mastering HTML and CSS by making my own portfolio. Used pure HTML and CSS, without any library support, including bootstrap. There are a little responsiveness issues, tried to handle them but could not do so everywhere.

*Next task is to make it totally reponsive and use bootstrap as much as possible.

Made it using bootstrap. A lot of alignment and responsiveness issues are handled but still some issues related to text and custom shapes persist.
